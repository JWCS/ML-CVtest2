There in my mk2 ML code there is an expansion func that, for everypoint that has an open space beside it, fills in that empty space(s). It's a simple few line func, but originally the values to be passed in were not logical points, but the magnitudes of the valid points. When expanded, the mags were also expanded. I won't use this, but it is archived. 

%This is older code when I retained and expanded the magnitudes. 
%   Except for some painful dual for loops, this gives each new surrounding
%   element a value of the average of the ones around it. 
%     OutMag = single( InOfMag ); %OutDir = single( InOfDir ); %2d matrices
%     seen = logical( OutMag ); newMagVals = zeros( size( OutMag ), 'single' );
%     %newDirVals = zeros( size( OutDir ), 'single' );
%     border = ~seen .* conv2( double( seen ), ones(3, 'single' ), 'same' );
%     newMagVals(:,:) = logical(border(:,:)) .* conv2( OutMag(:,:), ones(3), 'same') ./border(:,:);
%     newMagVals( isnan(newMagVals)) = 0;
%     %newDirVals(:,:) = logical(border(:,:)) .* conv2( OutDir(:,:), ones(3), 'same') ./border(:,:);
%     %newDirVals( isnan(newDirVals)) = 0;
%     OutMag = uint8( OutMag + newMagVals );
%     %OutDir = int16( OutDir + newDirVals );
